# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves the use of statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry.
All of the statistical analysis and visualizations is written in the R programming language.

The purpose of this analysis is to offer insights on the MechaCar's production to help the manufacturing team. In order to conduct this analysis, we will be using two datasets containing information related to the miles per gallon and the suspension coils of the MechaCar. We will be using the programming language R and its dplyr library to complete this analysis.


## Resources
- Data source: [MechaCar_mpg](/Resources/MechaCar_mpg.csv) , [Suspension_Coil](/Resources/Suspension_Coil.csv)
- Software : Rstudio

## Summary 

**1- Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG**

In this section, I loaded in the miles per gallon dataset. From there, I preformed a multiple linear regression to see if it could predict the miles per gallon (mpg) dependent variable by using the vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and all wheel drive (AWD) independent variables.
